# Drivers & Vehicles License Department Project

Drivers & Vehicles License Department Management System
My first complete real-world project, developed as part of [Course 19 (Full Real Project)](https://programmingadvices.com/p/19-fullrealproject) on the [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com) Platform under the guidance of instructor [Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abuhadhoud/).

This project demonstrates the practical application of layered architecture, including a Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. It showcases skills in database integration, object-oriented programming using C# and .NET Framework, and modular design principles, all aimed at building scalable and maintainable software systems.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and contribute!
