# Drivers & Vehicles License Department Project

Drivers & Vehicles License Department Management System
My first complete real-world project, developed as part of Course 19 on the ProgrammingAdvices Platform under the guidance of instructor Mohammed Abo-Hadhoud.

This project demonstrates the practical application of layered architecture, including a Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer. It showcases skills in database integration, object-oriented programming, and modular design principles, all aimed at building scalable and maintainable software systems.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and contribute!
